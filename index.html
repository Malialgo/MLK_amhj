      <a href="about/achievements.html">achievements</a>
      in his lifetime and has made history with the things he has done to <br />
      make the world better. One of the things that everyone in the world was
      made aware of through schooling was Dr. King's <br />
      "I have a dream" speech. A powerful speech to end racism and have civil
      economic rights in the united states.
