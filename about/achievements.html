      <u>Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Achievements</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
      MLK has done many things that have benefited this world tremendously, and
      during less than the 13 years of his leadership of the American Civil
      Rights Movement, African Americans attained progress towards racial
      equality.

          In 1955, King was hired as a a spokesman for the Montgomery Bus
          Boycott, a campaign by the African American population of Montgomery,
          AL to demand integration of the city bus lines. After #81 days of
          participation from the black community, the U.S. Supreme court decided
          that racial segregation in transportation was unconstitutional.

          In 1963, King led a coalition of many civil rights groups in a
          nonviolent campaign aimed at Birmingham, AL, which at the time was
          known as the "most segregated city in America". Witnessing the
          brutality of the city's police towards the people led to a national
          outrage resulting in a push for unprecedented civil rights
          legislation. It was during this campaign that Dr. King drafted the
          <q>Letter from a Birmingham Jail</q>, the manifesto of Dr. King's
          philosophy and tactics.

          In 1965, Congress went on to pass the Voting Rights Act, a set of laws
          that eliminated the remaining barriers to voting for
          African-Americans, who in some locales had been almost completely
          disenfranchised. This legislation resulted directly from the Selma to
          Montgomery, AL march for Voting Rights lead by Dr. King.
